#### `registerInstance`

```

<p>Registers instances that were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack.</p> <note> <p>We do not recommend using this action to register instances. The complete registration operation includes two tasks: installing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering the instance with the stack. <code>RegisterInstance</code> handles only the second step. You should instead use the AWS CLI <code>register</code> command, which performs the entire registration operation. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register.html"> Registering an Instance with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Stack</a>.</p> </note> <p>Registered instances have the same requirements as instances that are created by using the <a>CreateInstance</a> API. For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type. For more information about requirements for instances that you want to register, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register-registering-preparer.html"> Preparing the Instance</a>.</p> <p> <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions.
